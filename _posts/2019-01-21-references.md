### Bayesian Optimization

This is the fundamental paper <https://papers.nips.cc/paper/4522-practical-bayesian-optimization-of-machine-learning-algorithms.pdf>
As all the fundamental papers it is a bit obscure, especially on math parts. 

First of all, a super-nice explanation of what a gaussian process is in bayesian statistics:
<http://katbailey.github.io/post/gaussian-processes-for-dummies/>

A general introduction to hyperparameters optimization:

two very nice lessons on bayesian optimization:
